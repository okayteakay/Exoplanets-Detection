# Exoplanets-Detection
## WHY DETECT EXOPLANETS?
# The habitable zone is the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets. Imagine if Earth was where Mercury is. The Sun would cover entire the sky and  much of Earthâ€™s ocean and atmosphere would boil. "Exoplanets are planets beyond our own solar system." While there are multiple motivations for scientists to search for exoplents, the main one remains the big question - What is Some exoplanets have the necessary physical conditions (amount and quality of light from the star, temperature, atmospheric composition) for the existence of complex organic chemistry and perhaps for the development of Life (which may be quite different from Life on Earth)?
